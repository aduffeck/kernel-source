Subject: xen/pciback: Return error on XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix when device has MSI or MSI-X enabled
Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE-Xen specific
References: bsc#957990 CVE-2015-8551 CVE-2015-8552 XSA-157

The guest sequence of:

  a) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix
  b) XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix

results in hitting an NULL pointer due to using freed pointers.

The device passed in the guest MUST have MSI-X capability.

The a) constructs and SysFS representation of MSI and MSI groups.
The b) adds a second set of them but adding in to SysFS fails (duplicate entry).
'populate_msi_sysfs' frees the newly allocated msi_irq_groups (note that
in a) pdev->msi_irq_groups is still set) and also free's ALL of the
MSI-X entries of the device (the ones allocated in step a) and b)).

The unwind code: 'free_msi_irqs' deletes all the entries and tries to
delete the pdev->msi_irq_groups (which hasn't been set to NULL).
However the pointers in the SysFS are already freed and we hit an
NULL pointer further on when 'strlen' is attempted on a freed pointer.

The patch adds a simple check in the XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msix to guard
against that. The check for msi_enabled is not stricly neccessary.

This is part of CVE-2015-8551 + CVE-2015-8552 / XSA-157.
