# Kernel configuration file selection.
# See the arch-symbols script for a list of symbols defined.
# -syms excludes a flavor from the kernel-syms package (vanilla is excluded
# automatically).

#
# IMPORTANT: the subdirectory names map to cpuarch
#            kernel-binary and kernel-source rely on this
#

# We need an x86_64/default config because the users branch test script
# is x86_64-only
+x86_64		x86_64/default

+arm64		arm64/default
+arm64		arm64/vanilla
