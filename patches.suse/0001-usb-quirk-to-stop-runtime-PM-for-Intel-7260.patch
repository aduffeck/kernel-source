Subject: [PATCH] usb: quirk to stop runtime PM for Intel 7260
References: bnc#984460
Patch-Mainline: Never (upstream fixed this in firmware which we can't take)

The old firmware in the Intel 7260 BT modules is prone to crashes
if runtime power management is used. Our driver is too old to use
the newest firmware. Hence runtime PM is to be disabled for this
module.
