Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Clear crtc atomic flags at beginning of transaction
Git-commit: f1e2daea79e96a50cdbca1bdd1a70900e1af5da1
Patch-mainline: 4.2-rc1
References: boo#960021

Once we have full atomic modeset, these kind of flags should be in a
real intel_crtc_state that's tracked properly.  In the meantime, make
sure we clear out any old flags at the beginning of a transaction so
that we don't wind up seeing leftover flags from old transactions that
were checked, but never went to the commit step.  At the moment, a
failed check or prepare could leave stale flags behind that interfere
with the next atomic transaction.

V2: Just do a memset; the series this patch was originally part of    placed additional fields into the structure that shouldn't be    cleared, but that's no longer the case.
