Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Paper over too annoying warning
Patch-mainline: Never, just a tentative fix
References: boo#951738

The assert about plane inconsitency is almost harmless, and yet a
very die-hard thing.  The upstream introduced way too many changes
that are almost impossible to backport one by one, so for 4.1.y,
it's easier to just paper over it.
