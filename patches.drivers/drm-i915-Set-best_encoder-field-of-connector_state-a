Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Set best_encoder field of connector_state also when disabling
Git-commit: f61cccf3e9a4f7deae633b6c073a6e40ef8e86f3
Patch-mainline: 4.2-rc1
References: boo#955190

The best_encoder field of connector_state wasn't properly set when a
connector was being disabled, leading to an incosistent atomic state.

For now, this doesn't cause anything to blow up, because everywhere
we're using connector_state->best_encoder there is a check for
connector_state->crtc which is properly initialized. I reached the issue
while testing some patches I haven't sent out yet, that remove the usage
of intel_connector->new_encoder from check_digital_port_conflicts(). In
that case, it would be possible to trigger the converted version of the
WARN in that function.
